# **Pramaan Portal**

**"While others build marketplaces, we built the AI legal brain to run them."**

Pramaan Portal is a prototype for a next-generation, blockchain-based IP licensing platform built for the "\[Challenge Name\]" Hackathon. It turns every digital asset into an autonomous, self-governing entity capable of managing its own licensing through AI-assisted DAO governance.

This project demonstrates the core concept of the "Living License," where fractional owners (DAO) can vote on new licensing deals, advised by an AI "Legal-Brain" that analyzes proposals for compliance, strategy, and risk.

## **Tech Stack**

* **Framework:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)  
* **Language:** [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)  
* **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)  
* **Blockchain Simulation:** Local state (React Hooks) \- *Smart contracts to be built in Stage 2\.*  
* **AI Simulation:** Hard-coded analysis data \- *Integration with LLM planned for Stage 2\.*

## **Key Features (Prototype)**

* **Asset Dashboard:** View simulated minted digital assets.  
* **Asset Detail Page:** See creator SBT info (simulated), fractional ownership (DAO), and current license terms.  
* **Proposal System:** View incoming license proposals for an asset.  
* **AI Legal-Brain Analysis:** View a simulated AI analysis of a proposal, covering compliance, strategy, and risk.  
* **DAO Voting Simulation:** Click to vote on a proposal and see the simulated outcome (license update, fund distribution).
